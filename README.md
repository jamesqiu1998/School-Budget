# School Analysis
## Project Overview
Maria requested to have us analyze different aspects of a school report, which includes different school types, grades, and school budget. 
### Purpose
To collect, prepare, summarize, drilling down, compare and contrast datasets using different functions such as
- Removing duplicates
- Removing Null values
- Replace suffix that is not necessary
- Converting column to int type
- Using Mean, Max, Min to find different values
- Using groupby function to compare values

## Results
After cleaning and analysing the dataset, my findings are as follow:
- Students in Chartered school tend to do better in Math, but Public school has more budget as compared to Chartered schools. 
- Grade 9 students in chartered school has the highest average Math score, and grade 12 has the lowest. For public school, only grade 11 has the lowest mean.

- Even with a high school budget, it does not prove that student can perform better.
